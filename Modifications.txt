Additions:
	- Added most of part 2 
	- Made it so sheep can randomly run, meaning they will go faster than the rest
	- Cart doesnt move with a fixed speed. Instead it accelerates/decelerates so its harder to control (if not in my
	  opinion it was too easy)
	- Added a line so you can see where you will shoot
